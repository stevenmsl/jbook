  - In CSS, ::after creates a pseudo-element that 
    is the last child of the selected element.
  - this is a workarounrd to prevent the iframe
    element inside the preview component to
    receive the re-size events by accident
    in some cases. Instead this pseudo element
    which is on top of the iFrame will receive 
    the events while you are resizing the cell.
  - when you are dragging a dynamic class named
    react-draggable-transparent-selection will 
    be added to the body. You can use proper
    selector to add a pseudo-element while 
    you are dragging.
